# 6T-SRAM
This project involves designing and simulating a 6T SRAM cell using CMOS technology, including netlist creation, transient and static noise margin analysis, and verification of read/write stability through waveform plots. Key parameters like power, voltage, and robustness are optimized for reliable operation.
